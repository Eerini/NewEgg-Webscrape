# NewEgg-Webscrape
This project is my first hands on experience web scraping and using the BeautifulSoup library in python.

Using BeautifulSoup, the program retrieves data about the featured items in each category (Product name, product url, current price, original price, and promos)
When running the program the user can choose one category displayed in a list and the program will give information about the featured items in that specific category.
